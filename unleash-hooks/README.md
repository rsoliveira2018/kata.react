# React and Unleash

This project was created as a quick reference on how to deal with feature toggles using the Unleash API and proxy for a React Application.
Check the "index.js" file to see the usage of the unleash hooks as experimented.

### Remember
You are gonna need an Unleash Server and Proxy instance running (either locally or somewhere accessible) and you will have to set it on the index.js "config" constant as expected, alongside the client key and all the other information, otherwise the flags will always be retrieved as **false**.
